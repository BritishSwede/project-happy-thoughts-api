# Project Happy Thoughts API

I created a database for the Happy Thoughts project I did a few months ago using MongoDB/Mongoose and Express.

## The problem

This was the first time I made a database on my own. I used Mongoose schema and model. I used catch/error for the first time to show different status codes depending on the outcome.

If I had more time I would have added the possibility to add a tag to the thought, and also the option to add a name.
